# Rust time

Idk. I want to rust more. 
## Deps
Have rust and cargo installed. You want the pip packages `toml` and `clize`

## How to use stack
1. To create a new rust project `./run new <project_name>`
2. To setup Cargo.toml `./run configure`
3. To execute rust project `./run execute <project_name>`
